annualized income to 2009 dollars. ADJINC applies to variables FINCP and

* For 35 Census codes that were aggregated or used the XX or YY description 
for SOC, the Census description is used for the SOC title. 

 

** These codes are pseudo codes developed by the Census Bureau and are not 

 official or equivalent NAICS or SOC codes. 

 

 

Legend to Identify NAICS Equivalents 

 M = Multiple NAICS codes 

 P = Part of a NAICS code - NAICS code split between two or more Census 

 codes 

 S = Not specified Industry in NAICS sector - Specific to Census codes 

 only 

 Z = Exception to NAICS code - Part of NAICS industry but has a unique 

 Census code 

 

 

Note for both Industry and Occupation lists in Data Dictionary: 

 

NOTE: For additional information on NAICS and SOC groupings 

within major categories visit our website at:

**** The World Area of Birth (WAOB) in the PUMS dataset is based upon the 

Place of Birth (POB) variable in the full dataset, not the Place of Birth 

recode created for PUMS (POBP). POB contains more detailed place of birth 

information than POBP. Therefore, WAOB cannot be recoded from POBP. 

 

Data users should be aware that the area groupings for WAOB are based 

primarily upon United States administrative boundaries, not geographic 

boundaries. For example, Guam is grouped into "Puerto Rico and the U.S. 


Island Areas," although geographically it is located in Oceania. Not all 

places of birth are listed individually in POBP. Therefore the user 

cannot recreate an exact world area of birth variable from POBP based upon 

geographic location of birth.
